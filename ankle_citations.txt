    Abstract 	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine
    associations between level of kinesiophobia and improvement in
    physical function during recovery from lower extremity injury.
    METHODS: A total 430 adults (mean [SD]: age = 27.3 [6.4] years; sex 
    = 70.5% men; body mass index = 27.6 [5.2] kg/m2) were included in
    the analyses. Using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
    Information System, physical function was evaluated in parallel with
    treatment from a physical therapist at the initial visit and every
    3 weeks until final visit or up to 6 months. A Tampa Scale of
    Kinesiophobia (TSK-17) score of >41 indicated elevated TSK. Four TSK
    groups were identified: (1) TSK score improved from >41 at initial
    visit to <41 by final visit (TSK_I), (2) TSK score was <41 at
    initial and final visits (TSK-), (3) TSK score was >41 at initial
    and final visits (TSK+), and (4) TSK score worsened from <41 at
    initial visit to ≥41 by final visit (TSK_W). Linear mixed effects
    models were used to examine differences between groups in improved
    physical function over time, with adjustment for depression and
    self-efficacy. RESULTS: Groups with elevated kinesiophobia at the
    final visit had smaller positive improvements in physical function
    (mean change [95% CI]: TSK+ = 7.1 [4.8-9.4]; TSK_W: 6.0 [2.6-9.4])
    compared with groups without elevated kinesiophobia at the final
    visit (TSK_I = 9.8 [6.4-13.3]; TSK- = 9.7 [8.1-11.3]) by 12 weeks.
    CONCLUSIONS: Elevated kinesiophobia that persists or develops over
    the course of care is associated with less improvement in physical
    function within military and civilian cohorts. IMPACT: The findings
    of this prospective longitudinal study support the need to assess
    for elevated kinesiophobia throughout the course of care because of
    its association with decreased improvement in physical function. LAY
    SUMMARY: To help improve your physical function, your physical
    therapist can monitor the interaction between fear of movement and
    your clinical outcomes over the course of treatment.

    Abstract 	Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of morbidity
    and the most prevalent source of disability among soldiers. Their
    high prevalence in armed forces and limited ressources have led to
    problems related to access to physical rehabilitation care. To
    increase access, supervised group-based exercise programs for the
    most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders (low back pain,
    patellofemoral pain, rotator cuff-related shoulder pain or lateral
    ankle sprain) have been developed at a Canadian Armed forces (CAF)
    base, but their effectiveness has not been evaluated. The primary
    objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the
    mid- and long-term effects of these group-based training programs on
    pain severity and functional limitations, in comparison with usual
    individual physiotherapy care. Secondary objectives include
    comparing both interventions in terms of health-related quality of
    life, pain-related fear, and patients’ satisfaction.

        Identification of Risk Factors Prospectively Associated With
        Musculoskeletal Injury in a Warrior Athlete Population

    Item Type 	Journal Article
    Author 	Deydre S. Teyhen
    Author 	Scott W. Shaffer
    Author 	Stephen L. Goffar
    Author 	Kyle Kiesel
    Author 	Robert J. Butler
    Author 	Daniel I. Rhon
    Author 	Phillip J. Plisky
    Abstract 	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injuries are a primary source
    of disability. Understanding how risk factors predict injury is
    necessary to individualize and enhance injury reduction programs.
    HYPOTHESIS: Because of the multifactorial nature of musculoskeletal
    injuries, multiple risk factors will provide a useful method of
    categorizing warrior athletes based on injury risk. STUDY DESIGN:
    Prospective observational cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2.
    METHODS: Baseline data were collected on 922 US Army
    soldiers/warrior athletes (mean age, 24.7 ± 5.2 years; mean body
    mass index, 26.8 ± 3.4 kg/m2) using surveys and physical measures.
    Injury occurrence and health care utilization were collected for 1
    year. Variables were compared in healthy versus injured participants
    using independent t tests or chi-square analysis. Significantly
    different factors between each group were entered into a logistic
    regression equation. Receiver operating characteristic curve and
    accuracy statistics were calculated for regression variables.
    RESULTS: Of the 922 warrior athletes, 38.8% suffered a time-loss
    injury (TLI). Overall, 35 variables had a significant relationship
    with TLIs. The logistic regression equation, consisting of 11
    variables of interest, was significant (adjusted R2 = 0.21; odds
    ratio, 5.7 [95% CI, 4.1-7.9]; relative risk, 2.5 [95% CI, 2.1-2.9];
    area under the curve, 0.73). Individuals with 2 variables had a
    sensitivity of 0.89, those with 7 or more variables had a
    specificity of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The sum of individual risk factors
    (prior injury, prior work restrictions, lower perceived recovery
    from injury, asymmetrical ankle dorsiflexion, decreased or
    asymmetrical performance on the Lower and Upper Quarter Y-Balance
    test, pain with movement, slower 2-mile run times, age, and sex)
    produced a highly sensitive and specific multivariate model for TLI
    in military servicemembers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A better
    understanding of characteristics associated with future injury risk
    can provide a foundation for prevention programs designed to reduce
    medical costs and time lost.

    Abstract 	Purpose. To study the effects of adding supervised group
    physical therapy to unsupervised individualized therapy in
    ankylosing spondylitis. Methods. One hundred forty-four patients
    were randomized to exercises at home, or the same plus weekly group
    physical therapy for 9 months. Endpoints were spinal mobility,
    fitness[maximum work capacity by ergometry], functioning (Sickness
    Impact Profile, Health Assessment Questionnaire for the
    Spondylar-thropathies, and Functional Index), and patient's global
    assessment of change on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results.
    Thoracolumbar flexion and extension increased by an average of 0.5
    cm (9%) after home exercises, and by 0.9 cm (16%) after group
    therapy. Maximum load in ergometry decreased by 2 W (1%) after home
    exercises, but increased by 7 W (4%) after group therapy. Global
    assessment improved by 0.3 (6%)after home exercises, and by 1.7
    (34%) after group therapy. These three differenceswere statistically
    significant. There were no significant differences in chest
    expansion, cervical rotation, or the self-assessments of
    functioning. Conclusions. Group physical therapy proved superior to
    individualized therapy in improving thoracolumbar mobility and
    fitness, and had an important effect on global health reported by
    the patients.

        Neuromuscular training with injury prevention counselling to
        decrease the risk of acute musculoskeletal injury in young men
        during military service: a population-based, randomised study

    Abstract 	Background The rapidly increasing number of
    activity-induced musculoskeletal injuries among adolescents and
    young adults is currently a true public health burden. The objective
    of this study was to investigate whether a neuromuscular training
    programme with injury prevention counselling is effective in
    preventing acute musculoskeletal injuries in young men during
    military service. Methods The trial design was a population-based,
    randomised study. Two successive cohorts of male conscripts in four
    companies of one brigade in the Finnish Defence Forces were first
    followed prospectively for one 6-month term to determine the
    baseline incidence of injury. After this period, two new successive
    cohorts in the same four companies were randomised into two groups
    and followed prospectively for 6 months. Military service is
    compulsory for about 90% of 19-year-old Finnish men annually, who
    comprised the cohort in this study. This randomised, controlled
    trial included 968 conscripts comprising 501 conscripts in the
    intervention group and 467 conscripts in the control group. A
    neuromuscular training programme was used to enhance conscripts'
    motor skills and body control, and an educational injury prevention
    programme was used to increase knowledge and awareness of acute
    musculoskeletal injuries. The main outcome measures were acute
    injuries of the lower and upper limbs. Results In the intervention
    groups, the risk for acute ankle injury decreased significantly
    compared to control groups (adjusted hazards ratio (HR) = 0.34, 95%
    confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.15 to 0.78, P = 0.011). This risk
    decline was observed in conscripts with low as well as moderate to
    high baseline fitness levels. In the latter group of conscripts, the
    risk of upper-extremity injuries also decreased significantly
    (adjusted HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.99, P = 0.047). In addition,
    the intervention groups tended to have less time loss due to
    injuries (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04). Conclusions A
    neuromuscular training and injury prevention counselling programme
    was effective in preventing acute ankle and upper-extremity injuries
    in young male army conscripts. A similar programme could be useful
    for all young individuals by initiating a regular exercise routine.

    Abstract 	Background Despite being the most commonly incurred sports
    injury with a high recurrence rate, there are no guidelines to
    inform return to sport (RTS) decisions following acute lateral ankle
    sprain injuries. We aimed to develop a list of assessment items to
    address this gap. Methods We used a three-round Delphi survey
    approach to develop consensus of opinion among 155 globally diverse
    health professionals working in elite field or court sports. This
    involved surveys that were structured in question format with both
    closed-response and open-response options. We asked panellists to
    indicate their agreement about whether or not assessment items
    should support the RTS decision after an acute lateral ankle sprain
    injury. The second and third round surveys included quantitative and
    qualitative feedback from the previous round. We defined a priori
    consensus being reached at >70% agree or disagree responses. Results
    Sixteen assessment items reached consensus to be included in the RTS
    decision after an acute lateral ankle sprain injury. They were
    mapped to five domains with 98% panellist agreement—PAASS: Pain
    (during sport participation and over the last 24 hours), Ankle
    impairments (range of motion; muscle strength, endurance and power),
    Athlete perception (perceived ankle confidence/reassurance and
    stability; psychological readiness), Sensorimotor control
    (proprioception; dynamic postural control/balance), Sport/functional
    performance (hopping, jumping and agility; sport-specific drills;
    ability to complete a full training session). Conclusion Expert
    opinion indicated that pain severity, ankle impairments,
    sensorimotor control, athlete perception/readiness and
    sport/functional performance should be assessed to inform the RTS
    decision following an acute lateral ankle sprain injury. Trial

        Risk Factors for Injuries During Military Static-Line Airborne
        Operations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

    Item Type 	Journal Article
    Author 	Joseph Knapik
    Author 	Ryan Steelman
    Abstract 	Objective: To identify and analyze articles in which the
    authors examined risk factors for soldiers during military
    static-line airborne operations. Data Sources: We searched for
    articles in PubMed, the Defense Technical Information Center,
    reference lists, and other sources using the key words airborne,
    parachuting, parachutes, paratrooper, injuries, wounds, trauma, and
    musculoskeletal. Study Selection: The search identified 17 684
    potential studies. Studies were included if they were written in
    English, involved military static-line parachute operations,
    recorded injuries directly from events on the landing zone or from
    safety or medical records, and provided data for quantitative
    assessment of injury risk factors. A total of 23 studies met the
    review criteria, and 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Data
    Extraction: The summary statistic obtained for each risk factor was
    the risk ratio, which was the ratio of the injury risk in 1 group to
    that of another (baseline) group. Where data were sufficient,
    meta-analyses were performed and heterogeneity and publication bias
    were assessed. Data Synthesis: Risk factors for static-line
    parachuting injuries included night jumps, jumps with extra
    equipment, higher wind speeds, higher air temperatures, jumps from
    fixed-wing aircraft rather than balloons or helicopters, jumps onto
    certain types of terrain, being a female paratrooper, greater body
    weight, not using the parachute ankle brace, smaller parachute
    canopies, simultaneous exits from both sides of an aircraft, higher
    heat index, winds from the rear of the aircraft on exit
    entanglements, less experience with a particular parachute system,
    being an enlisted soldier rather than an officer, and jumps
    involving a greater number of paratroopers. Conclusions: We analyzed
    and summarized factors that increased the injury risk for soldiers
    during military static-line parachute operations. Understanding and
    considering these factors in risk evaluations may reduce the
    likelihood of injury during parachuting.
